summary: "BNES Lib Dems alone decide which Council buses to keep or cut. Labour asked how they decided. How many use the cut buses? How much CO2 will the cuts save or add each year to 2030? How many school kids lose their rides? How many elderly will need social services? How many disabled passengers are affected? Who was consulted & when?"
