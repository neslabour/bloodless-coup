summary: "WHERE'S THE REAL LIB DEM FOCUS? 1. BNES LibDems have just one bus job: running council buses for social need.
But they're stranding THOUSANDS with cuts - but only outside Bath city, severing Bath from its lifeblood communities across the region, turning rural non-drivers elsewhere
2. The choice is theirs. Only they decide what to spend & cut.
3. Cynical? You won't feel the axe 'til after May's election.
4. Joined up? It undermines the new rural shuttles, taking us to normal routes
5 .Thought-through? They refuse to say what figures they used
6. Green? They refuse to tell us how much CO2 this cut adds each year, up to
7. They refuse to say how many passengers, school kids, disabled people. elderly use the cut buses
8. The week before announcing their axed bus list, they told BBC Radio Bristol: the Lib Dems in Bath [not BathNES] are extremely committed to sustainable transport. You can't ask people to make shorter journeys and get out of their car to make shorter journeys if you don't have a proper public transport system. So we're committed to supporting all of our supported bus routes.' - But was this statement by their leader Cllr Kevin Guy true?"
