summary: "A week before revealing their axed bus list, BNES Lib Dems told BBC Radio Bristol: the Lib Dems in Bath [not 'BathNES'] are extremely committed to sustainable transport. You can't ask people to make shorter journeys and get out of their car to make shorter journeys if you don't have a proper public transport system. So we're committed to supporting all of our supported bus routes."
