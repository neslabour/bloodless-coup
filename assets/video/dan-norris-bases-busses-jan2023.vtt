Kevin Guy sitting in this studio almost two weeks ago, I asked him a direct question about subsidised buses, some 30 subsidised buses that Bath and North East Semester Council provide.


00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I asked him, are you going to carry on doing those? He sat in the studio and said yes on the record. He's gone back on that. He was relying upon the west of England combined authority, I think, to help support it, wasn't he?


00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.640
Well, he's not right to do that.


00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.080
These subsidised buses are paid for by the councils.


00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.400
My officers in the commune authority administer that.


00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.760
Could you get economies of scale if you obviously bid for buses right across a large region


00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.760
rather than a smaller council area?


00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:40.760
Exactly.


00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.360
And I can't answer for Kevin.


00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.600
He has to speak for himself.


00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.040
But what I can say is he has got slight form on this because him and the other leaders


00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.400
last year said that they would increase this, what so-called transport maybe.


00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:57.840
in other words, council money that goes to subsidised buses by up to 10% and they delivered


00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:04.360
a zero increase or nothing. So last year they made that decision, this year they've confirmed


00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.720
that by keeping it at that level and because of inflation, because it's so huge in the


00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:16.060
transport sphere, 40% plus, if you're not increasing anything and yet inflation is


00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.960
eating into the costs, so it makes the cost of everything more, you're going to get fewer


00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.360
bus services and that's exactly what he's not paying.
